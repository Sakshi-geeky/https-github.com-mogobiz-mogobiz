## Multi-Channel & Multi-Device
MogoBiz is designed with fully modular services that can be customized and extended as needed. These services are accessed using the REST / JSON protocol, which lets you develop your frontend in whatever language you prefer, or whatever language needed for the devices and channels your ecommerce site supports. Multi-channel and multi-device capabilities are inherent to the MogoBiz platform.

## Performance & Scalability
Mogobiz is a highly scalable platform based on reactive design patterns. It is built around the CQRS principle for instant rendition of your product database. Akka-HTTP and Elasticsearch are the core building blocks of our product. They maximize the scalability of your site and optimize the use of resources in the cloud.
